# Coin_Detection
We introduce “Coin Detector”, a simple application which can detect and count the numbers of each kind of NTD coins. The system input is just an image only with coins and the standard size of a ten-dollar coin, and the output is the information of coins in the image. With moderate light, good contrast of background and without filming angles, the coin detector can be very accurate. 
The coin detector is accomplished by a series of image processing, which includes filtering noises, finding edges, drawing contours, and finally cropping coins individually. As long as we crop coin images, we can focus on features of each. Among many features of coins, our coin detector only judges the kind by the size of each coin, which is the most distinctive feature. In the end, it can sum up the number of each kind and total dollars, and show it to users.
